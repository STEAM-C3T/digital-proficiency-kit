## 1. Conceptual Framework

**Purpose:**
To create a modular, open-access learning environment that strengthens teachers’ and students’ digital competence through creative web development tasks built on **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

**Pedagogical foundations:**

- EU _DigComp 2.2_ competence areas (information, communication, content creation, safety, problem-solving)
- Constructionist learning and _learning-by-making_
- STEAM integration (linking digital design with science, art, and sustainability themes)
- Inclusive digital pedagogy (browser-based, no installation required)

## 2. Development Phases

| Phase                                        | Description                                                                                                        | Expected Output                                           |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Needs Analysis and Framework Design**   | Define digital competence targets; collect baseline data from partner schools and teachers; map to DigComp levels. | Competence map, user personas, design brief               |
| **2. Pedagogical Model and Learning Design** | Create structure for learning units, assessment rubrics, and teacher-student interaction patterns.                 | Curriculum map, didactic model, learning outcome taxonomy |
| **3. Content Development**                   | Produce instructional materials, code examples, and classroom projects in HTML, CSS, JS.                           | Draft toolkit modules, documentation, visuals             |
| **4. Technical Implementation**              | Build browser-based environment or integrate with GitHub Pages/Moodle; test code playgrounds.                      | Functional prototype of toolkit platform                  |
| **5. Internal Review and Refinement**        | Peer review by partner schools; alignment with accessibility and usability standards.                              | Revised toolkit v1.0                                      |
| **6. Pilot Testing**                         | Conduct teacher and student pilots in partner countries; collect learning analytics and feedback.                  | Pilot report, recommendations                             |
| **7. Finalization and Dissemination**        | Improve materials; publish open version; attach Creative Commons licence; prepare guides and tutorial videos.      | Final toolkit v2.0, dissemination package                 |

## 3. Toolkit Architecture

**A. Structure of Modules**

| Module                     | Focus                                                 | Sample Tasks                                    |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Introduction to the Web | Understanding how websites work, file structure, tags | Create your first webpage with semantic HTML    |
| 2. HTML Foundations        | Content hierarchy, accessibility                      | Build a personal portfolio page                 |
| 3. CSS Styling and Layout  | Colors, typography, grid/flexbox                      | Style a science-themed webpage                  |
| 4. JavaScript Essentials   | Variables, loops, DOM manipulation                    | Add interactive features (buttons, animations)  |
| 5. Data and Visualization  | Display data with HTML Canvas or Chart.js             | Visualize environmental data for STEAM projects |
| 6. Creative Web Projects   | Combine art and computation                           | Create a digital artwork or interactive poster  |
| 7. Green STEAM Challenge   | Apply coding to sustainability                        | Develop a mini-app promoting an SDG theme       |

Each module includes:

- **Learning outcomes** mapped to DigComp and STEAM skills
- **Step-by-step tutorials and examples**
- **Practice tasks and reflection prompts**
- **Teacher notes and adaptation suggestions**
- **Assessment rubric** (creativity, functionality, collaboration, digital safety)

---

## 4. Technical Requirements

- All resources run in the **browser**, requiring only a text editor and modern web browser.
- Example projects hosted on **GitHub Pages** for transparency and reuse.
- Optionally integrate lightweight online editors (e.g., CodePen, Replit, StackBlitz, or an in-house sandbox).
- Clear folder structure:

```
digital-proficiency-kit/
│
├── modules/
│   ├── 01-html-basics/
│   ├── 02-css-layout/
│   ├── 03-js-fundamentals/
│   ├── 04-data-visualization/
│   └── 05-green-challenge/
│
├── assets/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── sample-data/
│   └── style/

├── docs/
│   ├── teacher-guide.md
│   ├── digcomp-mapping.md
│   └── assessment-rubric.md
│
└── index.html
```

## 5. Evaluation and Validation

**Indicators:**

- Improvement in teachers’ self-reported digital competence (pre/post survey).
- Quality and originality of student web projects.
- Engagement metrics from pilot platform (completion rate, time on task).
- Qualitative feedback from teachers (interviews, focus groups).

**Validation methods:**

- Learning analytics dashboard (simple usage tracking via GitHub or embedded scripts).
- Cross-partner review of learning outcomes and usability.
- Integration of feedback into final version (v2.0).
