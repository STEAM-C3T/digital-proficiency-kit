# Design Brief for the Toolkit

## Title: Digital Proficiency Kit – Web Technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## Purpose:

Provide teachers and students with structured learning resources and environments that build digital competences (per the competence map) through creative web‐based tasks in a STEAM context.

## Target users:

- _Teacher persona_ (e.g., Science/Math teacher with little coding background)
- _Student persona_ (e.g., aged 13-15, curious about digital creation, minimal prior experience)
  (Full set of user personas to be developed based on baseline study)

## Core learning outcomes (selected examples linked to competence map):

- Teacher will **design and deploy** a simple web page using HTML and CSS, thereby achieving 3.1 and 1.1 competence targets.
- Student will **write a JavaScript script** that responds to user input and manipulates the DOM, addressing 3.4 and 5.3.
- Both teacher & student will **evaluate the credibility** of online resources before integrating them into a web project (1.2).
- Student will **collaborate** with peers online to share and refine a web‐based STEAM artefact (2.4).

## Pedagogical approach:

- Use **learning-by-making**: learners create meaningful artefacts (web pages, interactive visuals) rather than only reading theory.
- Offer **progressive scaffolding**: beginners start with guided templates; move toward open-ended creative tasks.
- Include **reflection and self-evaluation**: learners map their artefacts to the competence map and reflect on growth.
- Emphasise **transfer to STEAM domains**: tasks integrate science, design, entrepreneurship themes to connect coding with real‐world relevance.

## Technical & usability requirements:

- All modules run **in browser** (no installation required) to ensure access across partner schools.
- Code samples use **vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript** to minimise dependency overhead and maximise transparency.
- Responsive design in CSS ensures usability on different screen sizes.
- Accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1) considered in example projects and templates.
- Modular folder and file structure to support localisation and translation.
- Version control via GitHub with clear branching strategy for updates and partner contributions.

## Content design:

- 7 Modules each with:

  - Learning outcomes mapped to competence map
  - Tutorial materials (text + video)
  - Practice tasks and challenge tasks
  - Teacher guide with adaptation options, assessment rubrics

- Assessment rubrics linked to competence levels (e.g., from A0→B1) so progress can be measured.
- Repository organised with a clear directory structure to support maintenance and localisation.

## Feedback and evaluation:

- Pilot in at least 3 partner schools with teacher and student groups.
- Collect both quantitative data (self‐assessments, task completion rates) and qualitative feedback (focus groups, teacher interviews).
- Use analytics (e.g., time spent, task success rates) to inform refinements.
- After pilot, toolkit version 1.0 refined and published as final version 2.0 under CC BY licence.

## Sustainability and dissemination:

- Host toolkit on GitHub Pages with open access.
- Provide translation templates for all modules to local languages of partners.
- Encourage teacher communities of practice to adapt and extend tasks.
- Prepare webinar/tutorial for partner schools and wider audience to raise awareness of the kit.

## Timeline (illustrative):

- Month 1-2: Baseline data collection, competence map finalisation
- Month 3: User persona development, design brief approval
- Month 4-8: Content development (modules 1-4)
- Month 9-12: Content development (modules 5-7) + platform build
- Month 13-15: Pilot testing
- Month 16-18: Refinement and final release
