# Competence Map

**Goal:** Provide a clear reference of digital competences (from DigComp 2.2) that the kit will address, showing current baseline level and target level for both teachers and students.

| Competence area (DigComp 2.2)        | Sub-competence ID & title                                              | Baseline level (teachers) | Target level (teachers) | Baseline level (students) | Target level (students) |

**Legend for proficiency levels:**

- A0/A1/A2 = Foundation levels (beginner)
- B1/B2 = Intermediate levels
  (Adapted for the school context; full eight‐level scale of DigComp 2.2 may be simplified)

**Notes:**

- Teachers’ baseline includes minimal or no programming experience (hence 3.4 set at A0).
- Students’ baseline set similarly low for programming; target is that they reach at least A2 or B1 for programming by the end of the kit.
- Safety and environment aspects are less emphasised but still included as cross‐cutting competences.
- The map can be refined after baseline data collection from partner schools.
