# Curriculum Map

## Didactic Model

This model describes how teaching, learning and interaction will be organised for each unit, with supporting teacher-student interaction patterns.

### Structure

1. **Activate** – Begin with a short scenario or question linking the unit to a STEAM-theme (e.g., “How could a web page visualise air-quality data?”).
2. **Explain / Demonstrate** – Teacher introduces or models key concept (e.g., semantic HTML, JavaScript event listener).
3. **Guided Practice** – Students work in pairs or small groups on a scaffolded task (template code) with teacher facilitation and formative feedback.
4. **Independent Creation** – Students create their own mini-project applying the concept (e.g., build a styled responsive webpage, or an interactive widget).
5. **Share & Reflect** – Students present their artefact, peer review, teacher leads discussion on what worked, what could improve.
6. **Extend / Challenge** – Optional extension tasks for advanced students or for integration across modules.
7. **Assessment & Feedback** – Use defined rubric to evaluate artefact and process; students self-assess progress in relation to competence map.

### Teacher-Student Interaction Patterns

- **Teacher as Facilitator**: guiding explorations, asking reflective questions, modelling coding thinking.
- **Student Collaboration**: pair-programming, peer review, sharing code and reflections.
- **Student Autonomy**: choice of design, code modifications, creative freedom under defined parameters.
- **Reflection Dialogue**: teacher prompts “How did your code respond to user input?” or “What would you change in your layout to enhance accessibility?”
- **Feedback Loop**: teacher gives formative feedback during guided practice; students iterate during independent creation.

### Inclusivity & Differentiation

- Provide multiple means of representation, expression and engagement (aligning with Universal Design for Learning)
- Scaffold for beginners with templates and step-by-step support; provide open-ended challenges for advanced learners.
- Ensure all artefacts adhere to accessibility standards (e.g., alt text for images, responsive layout, colour contrast).
- Encourage peer mentoring—students with more experience support others.

## Learning Outcome Taxonomy

This taxonomy maps learning-outcomes with verbs and levels of performance for both teachers and students. It corresponds to competence targets from the competence map.

### Sample Learning Outcomes for Students

- Student **describes** the structure of a web page using semantic HTML elements (Module 1)
- Student **constructs** a multi-page website using HTML and CSS that responds to different screen sizes (Module 3)
- Student **implements** a JavaScript function to respond to user input and dynamically manipulate the DOM (Module 4)
- Student **analyses** a dataset and **visualises** it using a web-based chart or canvas element (Module 5)
- Student **collaborates** with peers to design and **publishes** an interactive web artefact addressing a sustainability theme (Module 7)
- Student **evaluates** their own web artefact against accessibility and usability criteria, suggests improvements (Module 6)

### Sample Learning Outcomes for Teachers

- Teacher **identifies** appropriate opportunities within STEAM subjects to embed HTML/CSS/JS tasks
- Teacher **designs** a lesson plan incorporating web-coding artefacts with clear learning outcomes and assessment criteria
- Teacher **facilitates** student pair-programming and peer feedback sessions in a browser-based environment
- Teacher **assesses** student web artefacts using the provided rubric and **gives** constructive feedback to support next steps
- Teacher **reflects** on classroom implementation of the toolkit, **adapts** activities to local context and student needs

### Alignment with Bloom’s Taxonomy and DigComp Levels

- Lower levels (remember, describe) map to competence levels A1/A2; higher levels (construct, implement, evaluate) map to B1/B2 and beyond.
- Example: Student **implements** code → corresponds to DigComp 3.4 “Programming” at target B1.
- Example: Teacher **reflects and adapts** → corresponds to DigComp “Problem-solving” and “Empowering learners”.
