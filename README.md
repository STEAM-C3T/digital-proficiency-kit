# Digital Proficiency Kit

### _STEAM: From Campus to Classroom, Crafting Tomorrow (STEAM-C3T)_

**Erasmus+ Cooperation Partnerships in School Education (KA220-SCH)**
Developed by **Tallinn University, School of Digital Technologies**

---

## Overview

The **Digital Proficiency Kit** is an open-access learning and teaching resource that strengthens digital competence in **STEAM education** through creative web development using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
It supports both teachers and students in developing practical skills for building interactive digital artefacts that combine science, technology, art, and design thinking.

The toolkit follows the principles of **learning by making** and aligns with the **EU DigComp 2.2** competence framework.
Its structure and examples are designed to be easily adaptable for classroom, self-study, or blended learning settings without any installation or external software—only a modern web browser is required.

## Objectives

- Equip teachers with the ability to integrate coding and web design into STEAM lessons.
- Help students acquire foundational programming and digital creation skills.
- Encourage creative and interdisciplinary projects that connect code, data, and sustainability.
- Provide an open framework for teaching **computational and creative thinking** at primary and secondary levels.

## Pedagogical Approach

The toolkit is built upon three principles:

1. **Create to learn** – digital skills grow through making, testing, and sharing artefacts.
2. **Integrate to understand** – web coding links naturally with mathematics, art, and science.
3. **Reflect to improve** – teachers and learners assess their progress through authentic outcomes rather than abstract tests.

---

## Technical Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).
- Optional: GitHub Pages, CodePen, or Replit for online editing and publishing.
- All examples are written in **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, avoiding external dependencies to ensure full transparency.

## Contribution and Collaboration

Educators and partners are encouraged to adapt, translate, and extend the toolkit.
Feedback, new lesson ideas, and example submissions can be shared through Issues or Pull Requests in this repository.
