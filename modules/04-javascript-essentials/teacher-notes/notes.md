# Teacher Notes – Module 4: JavaScript Essentials

Adaptation options:

- Simplify: Provide a stub with `querySelector` calls and ask students to fill event handlers.
- Extend: Introduce arrays/objects to store state; add keyboard event handling.
- Accessibility: Use `aria-live` for dynamic updates; ensure controls have labels.

Assessment suggestions (DigComp 2.2 – Content Creation, Problem-solving):

- Criteria: Correct event handling, safe DOM updates, graceful error handling.
- Evidence: Working interactive example, comments explaining code decisions.
- Feedback: Suggest refactoring into functions; note opportunities for keyboard accessibility.
