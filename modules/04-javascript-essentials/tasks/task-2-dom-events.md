# Task: Build a Small Dynamic UI

Design goals:

- Implement a UI that updates based on user events (e.g., todo list, filterable list, counter with history).
- Keep state in JS and render from state; avoid inline HTML event attributes.

Acceptance criteria:

- Uses `addEventListener` for event handling and `classList`/`textContent` for DOM updates.
- Prevents default form submission where appropriate; handles empty input.
- Includes accessible labels and maintains focus order.

Deliverable:

- One HTML file with embedded JS (or a separate JS file) and a short comment explaining your state shape.
