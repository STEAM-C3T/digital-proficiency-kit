# Task: Visualize a Small Dataset

Design goals:

- Represent 4–8 numeric values visually using `<canvas>` or inline `<svg>`.
- Provide readable labels and value annotations.
- Ensure colours are distinguishable and have sufficient contrast.

Acceptance criteria:

- Data is stored as an array or object in JS; no external libraries.
- Bars/points/lines correctly map values to sizes/positions.
- Chart includes clear title and labels; no overlapping text.
- Code is commented to explain the scaling logic.

Deliverable:

- A single HTML file containing your visualisation.
- 2–3 sentence reflection: Why this chart type? How does it help interpret the data?
