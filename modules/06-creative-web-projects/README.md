# Module 6: Creative Web Projects

Explore generative visuals and interactive posters by combining HTML/CSS with JavaScript animation and parameters.

## Learning Outcomes

- Implements parameterized visuals and simple animation loops.
- Uses UI controls (e.g., sliders) to expose variables and support exploration.
- Documents creative process and evaluates design choices for readability and impact.

## Prerequisites

- Modules 1–4; Module 5 recommended for visual thinking.

## Estimated Time

- 2 lessons (90 minutes) with time for iteration.

## Materials

- Browser with JS support; text editor.

## Contents

- Units
  - [Unit 6.1 – Generative Art](./units/unit-6.1-generative-art.md) — Build an animated pattern with tweakable parameters.
- Examples
  - [generative-art.html](./examples/generative-art.html) — Animated grid of circles, colour cycling and sizing.
- Tasks
  - [Task: Create an Interactive Poster](./tasks/task-1-creative-poster.md) — Combine typography, colour, motion, and interaction.
- Teacher notes
  - [Notes](./teacher-notes/notes.md) — Accessibility captions and iteration suggestions.

## How This Module Works

1. Explore a generative example and identify parameters (count, size, colour, speed).
2. Build your own variation; expose 2–3 parameters via inputs.
3. Iterate on composition, contrast, and motion for clarity and expression.
4. Share and reflect on design intent and outcomes.

## Student Instructions (Step‑by‑Step)

1. Open `examples/generative-art.html`; change variables and see effects.
2. Create your own sketch: draw a grid or pattern and animate a property (e.g., colour, size, rotation).
3. Add controls (range inputs) to adjust parameters live.
4. Ensure motion is not overwhelming; provide a pause toggle if needed.
5. Document two iterations with screenshots and notes.

## Acceptance Criteria (Module 6 Project)

- Expression: Visual communicates an idea or theme consistently.
- Control: At least two parameters adjustable via UI; sensible ranges.
- Accessibility: Sufficient contrast; motion can be paused or slowed.
- Documentation: Includes brief process notes and iteration screenshots.

## Accessibility Checklist

- Motion: Provide pause/slow controls; avoid flashing content.
- Contrast: Ensure foreground/background contrasts adequately.
- Text: If text is included, maintain readability across variations.

## Differentiation & Extensions

- Scaffold: Starter loop with draw/update functions; basic slider wiring.
- Extension: Add export (PNG download) or save/load of parameter presets.

## Assessment & Evidence

- Use the creative project rubric (Teacher Toolkit) for expression, control, and accessibility.
- Evidence: HTML/JS files, two iteration screenshots, and summary notes.

## Quick Open (macOS)

```zsh
open ./examples/generative-art.html
```

## Try it

- Open the example and resize the window; adjust code parameters for different effects.
- Add simple UI sliders to expose variables (count, size, speed).
