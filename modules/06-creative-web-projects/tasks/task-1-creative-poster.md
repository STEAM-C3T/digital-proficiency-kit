# Task: Create an Interactive Poster

Design goals:

- Combine typography, colour, and motion to communicate a theme.
- Include at least one interactive control that influences the design.
- Provide a caption describing the concept and interaction.

Acceptance criteria:

- Visual hierarchy is clear; motion is purposeful (not distracting).
- Interaction changes the output meaningfully (not just colour swap).
- Page is responsive on mobile and desktop.
- Includes a short reflection on creative intent and iteration.

Deliverable:

- One HTML file (with optional separate CSS/JS files).
- 3–5 sentence artist statement describing the piece and its interaction.
