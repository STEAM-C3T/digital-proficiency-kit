# Task: Build a Content Page

Design goals:

- Create a small topic page with headings, paragraph, list, image, and a link.
- Use semantic tags where possible and provide alt text for images.

Acceptance criteria:

- Has `<h1>` and at least one `<h2>`; contains a list (`<ul>` or `<ol>`).
- Includes a figure with an `<img>` and descriptive `alt` text.
- External link uses `rel="noopener"` when `target="_blank"`.

Deliverable:

- One HTML file with minimal, clean structure.
