# Task: Style a Simple Portfolio Page

Design goals:

- Apply consistent typography (base font, sizes for h1–h3).
- Use spacing (margin/padding) to separate sections.
- Provide accessible link and button states (hover/focus).
- Ensure sufficient text contrast (aim for WCAG AA: ~4.5:1 for normal text).

Acceptance criteria:

- Uses class-based selectors for reusable styles; avoids excessive IDs.
- Headings have clear visual hierarchy; paragraphs are readable on mobile.
- Links have visible focus outline and hover change.
- No horizontal scrolling on screens ≥ 320px wide.
- HTML validates (no obvious nesting errors); CSS is commented where non-obvious.

Deliverable:

- Submit a single HTML file with embedded `<style>` or a separate CSS file.
- Include a short note explaining one design choice (typography, colour, spacing).
