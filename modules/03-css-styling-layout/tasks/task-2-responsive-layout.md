# Task: Build a Responsive Grid Layout

Design goals:

- Implement a card grid that adapts from 1 column (mobile) to 2 columns (tablet) to 3 columns (desktop).
- Keep spacing consistent and ensure readable typography at all sizes.

Acceptance criteria:

- Uses CSS Grid for the outer layout; optional Flexbox inside cards.
- Includes two media query breakpoints (suggested: 640px and 1024px).
- No horizontal scrolling at 320px; focus outlines remain visible.

Deliverable:

- A single HTML file with embedded CSS or separate `.css` file.
- Short note: Which breakpoints did you choose and why?
