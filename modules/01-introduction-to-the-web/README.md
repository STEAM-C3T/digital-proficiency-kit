# Module 1: Introduction to the Web

This module introduces how the web works and how to create a minimal, semantic HTML page. It’s browser‑only—open the example files directly in your browser.

## Learning Outcomes

- Describes how browsers request and render pages (client–server basics).
- Identifies and uses core semantic HTML elements for page structure.
- Produces a minimal, accessible web page with headings, links, lists, and images.
- Reflects on accessibility choices (alt text, heading order, link text).

## Prerequisites

- None. Basic computer literacy and a modern browser.

## Estimated Time

- 1–2 lessons (45–90 minutes) depending on depth of discussion.

## Materials

- Modern web browser (Chromium, Firefox, Safari).
- Text editor (VS Code, browser-based editor, or similar).

## Contents

- Units
  - [Unit 1.1 – What is the Web & How Does It Work?](./units/unit-1.1-what-is-the-web.md) — Overview of browsers, servers, and how pages load.
  - [Unit 1.2 – Basic Structure of a Web Page](./units/unit-1.2-basic-structure.md) — Semantic HTML layout using header, main, and footer.
- Examples
  - [minimal-page.html](./examples/minimal-page.html) — A minimal semantic HTML5 page to inspect and extend.
- Tasks
  - [Task: Your First Webpage](./tasks/task-1-first-webpage.md) — Build a simple, accessible page with semantic tags.
- Teacher notes
  - [Notes](./teacher-notes/notes.md) — Adaptations, accessibility, and assessment suggestions.

## How This Module Works

1. Learn concepts with Units 1.1–1.2 (how the web works; semantic page).
2. Explore the provided `examples/` by opening them in the browser.
3. Complete guided practice and then the independent task under `tasks/`.
4. Record reflections on what makes the page accessible and semantic.

## Student Instructions (Step‑by‑Step)

1. Read Unit 1.1 to understand the browser–server model and URLs.
2. Read Unit 1.2 and inspect `examples/minimal-page.html` in the browser.
3. Create your own minimal page for a topic of your choice:
   - Use `header`, `main`, and `footer`.
   - Include at least one heading hierarchy (`h1` + subheadings), one list, and at least two links with meaningful text.
   - Add an image with descriptive `alt` text.
4. Use the browser’s Inspect/Developer Tools to view and verify semantic structure.
5. Complete the reflection prompts in the task file.

## Acceptance Criteria (Module 1 Project)

- Structure: Uses semantic layout (`header`, `main`, `footer`) and logical heading order.
- Content: Includes links with descriptive text, at least one list, and an image with `alt`.
- Accessibility: Sufficient contrast in default styles; keyboard focus visible on links.
- Clarity: Page title communicates purpose; file opens cleanly in a browser.
- Reflection: Answers prompts about semantic choices and accessibility.

## Accessibility Checklist

- Alt text: All non‑decorative images have meaningful `alt` text.
- Headings: Start at `h1`; do not skip levels when possible.
- Links: Use descriptive link text (avoid “click here”).
- Keyboard: Tab through links; focus is visible.

## Differentiation & Extensions

- Scaffold: Provide a starter HTML template with comments.
- Extension: Add a simple navigation list, cite a source with a proper link, and include a figure with `figcaption`.

## Assessment & Evidence

- Use the module task rubric in the Teacher Toolkit to evaluate structure, accessibility, and reflection quality.
- Evidence: student HTML file(s) and brief written reflections.

## Quick Open (macOS)

```zsh
open ./examples/minimal-page.html
```

## Try it

- Open any `.html` file in your browser (double‑click or drag‑and‑drop).
- Use View Source / Inspect to connect the unit notes with the code.
