# Task: SDG Mini‑App

Design goals:

- Identify a sustainability theme (e.g., waste reduction, energy, water).
- Build a small web app with a clear interaction and feedback.
- Explain how the app supports awareness or behaviour change.

Acceptance criteria:

- Includes at least one interactive element (input/button) and dynamic output.
- Stores simple state (e.g., score, preferences) using `localStorage`.
- Provides a short help or "About" section describing purpose and usage.
- Accessible labels for controls; no essential info conveyed by colour alone.

Deliverable:

- One HTML file (with optional CSS/JS files) and a 100–150 word write‑up.
- Screenshot or short screen recording demonstrating the app.
