# Module 7: Green STEAM Challenge

Apply your skills to build a small sustainability‑focused web app linked to SDG themes. Keep scope small and impactful.

## Learning Outcomes

- Plans and implements a small purpose‑driven web app with clear user flows.
- Persists simple state responsibly (e.g., `localStorage`) and explains privacy tradeoffs.
- Communicates sustainability impact with clear metrics or narratives.

## Prerequisites

- Modules 1–4 required; 5–6 helpful depending on idea.

## Estimated Time

- 2–4 lessons (90–180 minutes) for planning, build, and sharing.

## Materials

- Browser and text editor; optional open datasets (CSV/JSON) if applicable.

## Contents

- Units
  - [Unit 7.1 – Build a Sustainability Mini‑App](./units/unit-7.1-green-mini-app.md) — Plan–build–test a simple app with persistence.
- Examples
  - [green-mini-app.html](./examples/green-mini-app.html) — Track daily green actions; persists state with localStorage.
- Tasks
  - [Task: SDG Mini‑App](./tasks/task-1-sdg-mini-app.md) — Design and explain a small app that supports awareness or behaviour change.
- Teacher notes
  - [Notes](./teacher-notes/notes.md) — Ethics, privacy, and assessment guidance.

## How This Module Works

1. Choose an SDG‑aligned theme and define a very small, specific user goal.
2. Prototype the UI (paper or HTML) and list core interactions.
3. Build the core flow; add simple persistence if appropriate.
4. Test with a peer, refine copy and accessibility, and present impact.

## Student Instructions (Step‑by‑Step)

1. Pick a focus (e.g., tracking green actions, comparing CO₂ of choices, or a tips library).
2. Outline the core flow (add/view/update) and sketch screens.
3. Build a minimal interface with semantic HTML; add JS for interactions.
4. If using `localStorage`, explain what is stored and how to reset or export.
5. Add simple metrics (counts, points) and a brief explanation of why they matter.
6. Prepare a short demo highlighting the problem, solution, and impact.

## Acceptance Criteria (Module 7 Project)

- Purpose: Clear, SDG‑aligned goal and simple user flow.
- Functionality: Core interactions work; persistence (if used) is explained.
- Accessibility: Keyboard operable; clear text labels; contrast meets basics.
- Ethics/Privacy: Discloses stored data and offers a reset.
- Communication: Explains impact and limitations honestly.

## Accessibility Checklist

- Operability: All controls reachable via keyboard; visible focus.
- Text: Clear language; avoid jargon; headings structure content.
- Data: If data is shown, provide textual summaries or tables.

## Differentiation & Extensions

- Scaffold: Provide a starter mini‑app skeleton with sections and placeholder handlers.
- Extension: Import a small open dataset; add filtering and basic visualization.

## Assessment & Evidence

- Use the project rubric (Teacher Toolkit) for purpose, usability, and ethics.
- Evidence: HTML/JS files, demo notes, and reflection on impact.

## Quick Open (macOS)

```zsh
open ./examples/green-mini-app.html
```

## Try it

- Open the example, tick actions, refresh the page—progress remains (localStorage).
- Add new actions or scoring rules and discuss impact.
